CV app. Finished. 
I'm using: Bootstrap + Thymeleaf + Spring Boot(v3.1.5) with Spring Security(6.1.5) + H2 database
To run it you have to use IntelliJ and open CV_Thymeleaf directory using it. 
Then find and run this file : CV_Thymeleaf/src/main/java/com/example/cv_thymeleaf/CvThymeleafApplication.java

After application starts, page in web browser will be available at address:
http://localhost:8080/

You can watch without logging cv from index page.
You can log with existing users (login: user , password: user) or create your own new user. 
In logged mode you can edit all user data.
With login/password admin/admin you can delete CV's.g
